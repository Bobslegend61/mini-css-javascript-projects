# MINI CSS/JS/JS ALGORITHM PROJECTS

Projects i build so as to learn more on css, vanilla javascript and also JS algorithm challenges.

## Projects

### `Ambient Light Events`

Basically, its just a way for an application to be aware of any changes in the light intensity(brightness).  
This project will change the background color and text color based on the light intensity. All i'm saying is the dark and light mode.

### `Javascript Cardio`

This is basically solving algorithm challenges to better improve on my critical thinking and logic.

### `html-css-js > p1`

Went on dribble and tested my html and css skill with:
